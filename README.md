# Hyperterm: Pulse

This is a minor tweak from [hyperterm-blink](https://github.com/amio/hyperterm-blink), with just different CSS rules to make 
the cursor pulse a bit more organically.

[not published on npm yet]

### Install

1. Open HyperTerm's preferences with `Cmd+,` (or manually at `~/.hyperterm.js`) with your editor.
2. Update your list of plugins to include `hyperterm-pulse`, like so:

  ```js
  plugins: [
    'hyperterm-pulse'
  ],
  ```
3. Fully reload HyperTerm (`Cmd+Shift+R`), and tada!
